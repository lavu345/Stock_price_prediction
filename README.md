# Stock_price_prediction

This project uses Machine Learning models to predict the next-day stock closing price based on historical financial data. It combines data preprocessing, feature engineering, and advanced regression techniques to forecast market trends, visualize insights, and help investors make more informed decisions.

⚙️ Workflow
Data Collection: Historical stock data (e.g., Tesla 2014–2023 dataset).
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, scaling, and deriving technical indicators.
Feature Engineering: Added lag features, RSI, MACD, SMA, EMA, and ATR for better prediction accuracy.
Model Training: Tested multiple models to identify the most accurate predictor.
Evaluation: Used RMSE, MAE, and R² metrics to assess model performance.
Deployment: Built a Flask web app for real-time user interaction and visualization.

🧰 Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3
Backend: Flask (Python)
Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas, Joblib
Visualization: Matplotlib, Plotly
Deployment: Flask local server (extendable to Render)

🧠 Key Learnings
Time-series feature engineering
Model performance comparison
Flask integration for ML models
Data visualization and interpretability
